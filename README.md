# VanGogh [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PSPDFKit-labs/VanGogh.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PSPDFKit-labs/VanGogh)

Great things are done by a series of small things brought together. RxJava meets Animations.

## Introduction

VanGogh is a lightweight library that takes Android view animation logic and binds it with RxJava2, providing a simple and powerful API for manipulating animations workflow.

It also provides various pre-made commonly used animations such as fading, rotating, moving, etc. with new ones constantly being added. Another thing that you get are the base animation wrappers so you can create your own complex animations with custom actions.

For documentation on how to use the library, [please check the VanGogh wiki page](https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/VanGogh/wiki).
